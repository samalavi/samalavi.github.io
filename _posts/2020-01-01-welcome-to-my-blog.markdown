Hello everyone and welcome to my blog!

I am Sam, and here is a home for my blog post!

I am a long-time techie with a large history in computer industry and programming, and I am also very excited to share with you insights and my favourite technical topics all about computerising things, mainly focused on Software Craftsmanship and Cloud Computing, also delighted to involve you in sharing my professional and personal experiences.

Obviously, there is not much on here at the moment, but hopefully, there will be soon!

If you want to know more about me just stay here and look around, and always feel free to leave any comment, question and feedback.

Thanks for stopping by, and hope you enjoy it!

Cheers,
Sam
